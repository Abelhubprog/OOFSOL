// Multi-agent orchestrator pattern
const orchestrator = new AIOrchestrator({
  scout: new WalletAnalysisAgent(),
  director: new StoryGenerationAgent(), 
  artist: new VisualDesignAgent(),
  publisher: new CrossChainAgent()
});
```

### **Error Handling:**
All API endpoints must include comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes and user-friendly messages.
