## üéØ OOF Platform - Production-Ready Development Guide (Updated)

The OOF Platform is a revolutionary Solana-based social media engagement platform that transforms crypto trading failures ("OOF Moments") into shareable, monetizable, and gamified content. It leverages AI for personalized experiences and cross-chain technology (Zora Protocol on Base) for NFT minting, aiming to create a "Regret Economy".

## üìã Quick Commands

**Development (Windows):**
```bash
dev-win.bat         # Recommended: Starts full dev server (API + Vite) with DB skip for Windows
npm run dev:safe    # Cross-platform safe mode, skips DB check
npm run dev:win     # PowerShell alternative, skips DB check
npm run dev         # Standard cross-platform, may have DB WebSocket issues on Windows
npm run dev:simple  # API only with basic HTML serving (no Vite)
```

**General Development:**
```bash
npm run check       # TypeScript type checking
npm run db:generate # Generate Drizzle migration (after schema changes)
npm run db:migrate  # Apply database migrations
npm run db:push     # Push schema changes (dev only, careful)
npm run db:studio   # Open Drizzle Studio (database admin)
```

**Production:**
```bash
npm run build       # Build client (Vite) and server (esbuild)
npm run start       # Run production build (after building)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### **Current Implementation Status: ~60% to Production-Ready Vision**

**‚úÖ Strong Foundations & Partially Implemented Frontend:**
- **Frontend (`client/`):** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Wouter, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui. Many pages (25+) and components (30+) exist, with some recent UI/UX overhaul (e.g., `Landing.tsx`, `OOFMoments.tsx`). Dynamic Labs for wallet connections.
- **Backend (`server/`):** Express.js, TypeScript. Structures for services, AI, middleware are present. WebSocket manager (`server/websocket/websocketManager.ts`) exists.
- **Database (`shared/schema.ts`, `server/db.ts`):** Comprehensive Drizzle ORM schema for PostgreSQL (Neon). Database connection and basic utility functions (`server/db/utils.ts`) are set up. Windows compatibility for Neon driver addressed.
- **AI Concepts:** Multi-agent (Scout, Director, Artist, Publisher) architecture conceptualized (`server/ai/orchestrator.ts`, `server/ai/config.ts`).
- **Strategic Vision:** Strong "Regret Economy" concept outlined in `STRATEGIC_ANALYSIS.md` and `BREAKTHROUGH_FEATURES.md`.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Implemented & Needs Significant Work:**
- **Backend Services & APIs:** Many API endpoints in `server/routes.ts` are placeholders, use mock data, or are incomplete. `server/routes-clean.ts` and `server/routes/simple.ts` reflect ongoing refactoring. Critical services like `oofMomentsService.ts`, `walletAnalysisService.ts`, `tokenAdvertisingService.ts` need full implementation and connection to live data/AI.
- **AI Agent System:** LangGraph integration and the actual logic for each AI agent (analysis, narrative, visual, publishing) are not implemented. Current AI generation is basic.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Solana on-chain data fetching (`server/services/solanaService.ts`, `productionSolanaService.ts`) and Zora NFT minting (`server/services/zoraIntegration.ts`) logic needs to be robust, fully tested, and integrated end-to-end.
- **Core Features:** While UI for many features exists, the backend logic, data flow, and AI integration are often missing or incomplete for OOF Moments, Token Ads, Campaigns, Gaming elements.
- **Mobile-First UI/UX:** Initial UI overhaul on some pages, but a consistent, polished, mobile-first experience across all 25+ pages is needed. Many pages still have MVP-level UI.

**‚ùå Critical Missing Pieces for Production:**
- **Fully Functional APIs:** Most APIs are not production-ready and need data validation, error handling, and connection to real services.
- **Complete AI Pipeline:** The AI agent orchestrator and individual agent logic for generating high-quality OOF moments.
- **Payment Processing:** Stripe/crypto payments for Token Advertising and other potential revenue streams.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit, integration, and E2E tests are largely absent.
- **Data Integrity & Seeding:** Production data seeding and robust data management practices.
- **Security Hardening:** Thorough security review, CSP, advanced rate limiting, etc.
- **Performance Optimization:** Bundle optimization, lazy loading, caching across the application.
